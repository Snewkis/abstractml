## Our Mission

Primarily, our mission at LineScript is to help beginners and experts alike make their first contribution, and any that follow, to open source, and to find their place in the vast community. To do so, we created clear-cut contribution guides and examples, created rich documentation, have formulated a welcoming community, and are always around ourselves to lend a helping hand.

Secondarily, our mission at LineScript is to provide a way to develop interfaces for the web that is cleaner and more user-friendly than HTML. That means we removed clumped code, ugly opening/closing tag combinations, and trying to squeeze attributes into tags. The LineScript compiler only allows for one tag to be on a line, and it must follow a strict grammar. This leads to more uniform code that is nicer to the developer.

## What is LineScript? 

LineScript is a compiled programming language that is written in statements broken up by line to represent the page structure. It is compiled into a valid HTML document at runtime using the LineCompiler, and can be used to create real webpages. 

The structure of the document is inspired by a combination of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and [Haskell](https://haskell.org), while the tag names are close alterations of HTML. This leads to extremely clean code that is familiar to anyone who has developed for the web, making LineScript the perfect beginner language.

For styling documents in LineScript, you can link to external style sheets (such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or [Skeleton](https://getskeleton.com)), use inline CSS, or use your own custom style sheet. All function of CSS3 is allowed, and extensions such as WebKit are able to be used.

JavaScript can be embedded in LineScript to interact with storage, the parsed HTML, servers, and more. LineScript also includes the ability to use JavaScript libraries such as [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

However, LineScript does not support embedded style sheets or scripts. All CSS or JavaScript must be written inline or in a separate document.
